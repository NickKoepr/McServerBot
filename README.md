## Features
### **Set a Minecraft server you want information from.**
Get the information about the server that you have specified.
Simply type `[prefix] serverstatus` to get the information about the server.

### **Get the server information in a embed in Discord.**
Including server ip, server version, player count and the names of the online players.

### **Simple setup.**
When you run the jar file, the bot will ask you some questions such as your Discord bot token, your server ip, your server port, the prefix that you want to use and the number of players you want to show if someone uses the command. 


**Made the Discord bot with JDA and https://minecraft-api.com/ to get the Minecraft server information.**

## Contributing
If you want to change or add something, you can always create a pull request. If you find a error, you can always create a Issue.

**_Using Java 16 and Gradle._** 

*You can use the bot, but the main purpose for me is to learn more about Java and making Discord bots with JDA by making this project :)*
