## Extra information.

**Made the Discord bot with JDA and used https://minecraft-api.com/ to get the Minecraft server information.**

There is a chance that some elements will not work properly. The API cannot get the player names from a bungeecord server for example!

You can use the bot, but the main purpose for me is to learn more about Java and making Discord bots with JDA by making this project :)

**_Used Java 16 and Gradle for this project._**
